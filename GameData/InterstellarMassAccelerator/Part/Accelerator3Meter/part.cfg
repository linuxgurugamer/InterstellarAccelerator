	description = A larger version of the X12 Mass Accelerator, the X13 Mass Accelerator is designed for building ground-based launch infrastructures for 3.75 meter rockets- or 2.5 meter rockets with large projecting fins.  The coils are 50% thicker to maintain the same performance as the X12, but the Square-Cube Law and other such factors yield moderate mass-savings on insulation, electronics, and structural reinforcement.  Don't expect this to be easy to launch to orbit though- larger mass drivers are still much heavier for the performance they provide...
