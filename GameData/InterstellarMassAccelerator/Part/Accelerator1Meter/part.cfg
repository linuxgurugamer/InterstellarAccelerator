	description = A more sane mass driver for a more sane rocket scientist, the X11 Mass Accelerator is a subscale version of the X12 Mass Accelerator.  As it happens, the costs associated with manufacturing, handling, and testing a mass driver decrease substantially with size up until a certain point- as do the difficulties associated with launching such a device to orbit!  Smaller mass drivers are more mass-efficient, and the X11 coils are 50% thinner than those of the X12, but this effect is somewhat mitigated by the actions of the Square-Cube Law and similar factors on coil-insulation, electronics, and structural mass.
