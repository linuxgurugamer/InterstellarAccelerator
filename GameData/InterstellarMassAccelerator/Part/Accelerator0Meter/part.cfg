	description = Miniaturization of mass driver technology can only proceed to a certain point before the forces involved threaten to rip the payload apart.  The X10 Mass Accelerator is not simply a 1/4th-scale version of the X12 Mass Accelerator, it has much thinner conducting coils relative to its size- as the ability to accelerate a payload massing 1250 kg and 3.25 meters long at 240 g's would not be practical.  The X10 is limited to a "mere" crushing 60 g's of acceleration for the same payload instead- the same as the X11 Mass Accelerator.  This is achieved by reducing the conducting coil thinkness by 87.5% compared to the X11 instead of by only 50%, and replacing the extra volume with a lightweight structural insulating foam.  Additional mass-savings result.
