	description = The X12 Mass Accelerator was originally intended to be a super powerful electromagnet for the orbital particle accelerator experiment.  When it was powered up for the first time every tool on the shop floor was sent rushing toward it and several engineers got stuck to the center.  We noted down that it was too powerful.  Our scientists came up with the idea to pulse power through it as a way to launch a mass off world.
