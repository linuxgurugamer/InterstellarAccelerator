	description = Designed to give 3.75 meter rockets with radial fins and other projections a boost from the surface of Kerbin towards orbit, the X15 Mass Accelerator should not be laughed at- but only a truly insane engineer would try to lift this enormously-heavy device to orbit!  Fortunately, while the conducting coils themselves are 8x heavier than in the X12, mass-savings on insulation, electronics, and structural reinforcement have resulted in a nearly 10% decrease in mass compared to its volume, thanks to the Square-Cube Law and other such factors at work.
